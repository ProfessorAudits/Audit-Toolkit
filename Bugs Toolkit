A security issue in Solidity boils down to smart contracts not behaving the way they were intended to. This can fall into four broad categories:

Funds getting stolen
Funds getting locked up or frozen inside a contract
People receive less rewards than anticipated (rewards are delayed or reduced)
People receive more rewards than anticipated (leading to inflation and devaluation)
